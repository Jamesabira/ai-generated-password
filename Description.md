Project Title: AI Password Generator
Description
The AI Password Generator is an open-source project that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to generate strong and unique passwords for users. With the increasing number of online services and the growing concern for online security, it has become more important than ever to use strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack.

This project aims to provide a simple and user-friendly tool that generates complex and secure passwords based on the user's requirements. The AI algorithm uses a combination of characters, numbers, and special characters to create unique passwords that are difficult to hack.

The user can input specific requirements such as the length of the password, the inclusion of certain characters, and the exclusion of commonly used words or phrases. The generated passwords are stored in an encrypted database, and the user can easily retrieve them whenever needed.
